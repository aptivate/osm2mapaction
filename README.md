osm2mapaction
=============
This repositiory contains a series of scripts which:
1. Enable the MapAction support base to take OSM data from the geofabrik server (as a master PBF file)
2. Provide a method for the MapAction field team to apply the latest change file to the master.
3. Convert the OSM PBF file into ESRI shapefiles and split into the different thems and categories in the MapAction data naming convention
